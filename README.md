## Overview ##
The purpose of this personal changelog was to keep a visual record of my progress and growth this month - not just as a developer, but also physically and mentally.  


#### Agenda ####
1. Go back and redo select previous assignments from my time at Prime Digital Academy as a refresher and to help keep my knowledge of React.JS/full-stack coding sharp (not being used in current position)
2. Begin ketosis diet - no starch or sugars, intermittent fasting (16:8), drinking lots of water, monitering diet every meal to ensure meeting macros using Carb Manager app. 
3. [Complete at least one Percipio knowledge channel every week (Ruby, C#, Java, etc).](https://chrobinson.percipio.com/playlist) 
4. Read at least 4 books on my [GoodReads "to-read" book list.](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/6254630-susannah?shelf=to-read) 
5. Yoga every Tuesday
6. Get 7-8 hours of sleep every night
